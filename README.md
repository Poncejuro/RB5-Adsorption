# RB5-Adsorption

This simulations are about the adsorption phenomenon, The system used are the dye RB5 and chitosan films

Phyton folder have scripts to column simulation, the parameter adjustment to the coeficient kf and the optimization in a profile of kf along time.
Simulik folder have the Scripts to the Feedback control in the Breakthrough curves, using the inlet velocity how the manipulated variable, 
 before disturbances in the feeding concentration.
